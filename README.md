# Description
This repository will serve as a workspace for projects in my backend development course. 

# Overview
This repository will store resources and project files for my backend development course. 

## [git-reference.md](./git-reference.md)
git-reference.md contains information on useful git commands

## [learning-log.md](./learning-log.md)
learning-log.md contains documentation of my backend development goals

## [resources.md](./resources.md) 
resources.md contains links to useful resources and articles. These resources can provide assistance with specific concepts, tools, or projects. 

## Project Folders
This repository contains project folders for each unit's project. Documentation for each project will be added in the project folder's README.md file as the course progresses. 
- [Unit 2 - Version Control](./unit-02-version-control/README.md)
- [Unit 3 - Backend Scripting](./unit-03-backend-scripting/README.md)
- [Unit 4 - Advanced Scripting](./unit-04-advanced-scripting/README.md)
- [Unit 5 - RESTful APIs](./unit-05-restful-apis/README.md)

# Learning Objectives
Throughout this course, I am excited to learn and practice concepts to help me handle common backend processes for a range of applications. In addition, I am excited to get exposed to new tools, such as Node.js, and learn how to leverage them for modern projects. 

Through all this, I hope to develop skills that I can use in future roles throughout my career, and I hope these skills will help to open doors for me when I graduate this Spring.

# How I Plan to Use this Repository
Throughout the semester, I plan to use this repository to organize my projects, notes, and resources. I also hope to use this repository to record my progress while learning backend development. This way, I can be proactive about my education, making sure to always be intentional about learning the skills and concepts I want to learn while taking the initiative to research independently whenever neccessary.
